	<h2> Welcome! </h2>
	<p> My name is Caroline Heys and I'm glad you chose to stop by. I graduated from UGA in May 2017 as a Communication Studies major and just completed the Front End Web Development course at General Assembly. Through my courses and work experience, I am skilled in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Microsoft Office Suite and WordPress. This website is a portfolio of the different projects I worked on as at General Assembly. Just click on the portfolio tab to start exploring. </p>
